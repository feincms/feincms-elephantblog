Pinging
-------

The Pinging app uses the management command manage.py blogping to generate the
pings for the search engines. Set it up to run as a cron job.

You need to add the following statements to your settings file::

    BLOG_TITLE = 'My great blog'
    BLOG_BASE_URL = 'http://mysite.com/blog/'

Then register the extension. In yourapp.models.py::

    Entry.register_extensions('blogping',)

Add `pinging` to your `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`.

Here is a list of servers that can be used for pinging:
