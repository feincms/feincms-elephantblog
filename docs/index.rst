ElephantBlog - An extensible Blog Module based on FeinCMS
=========================================================

Every Django Developer has written its own Django-based blog. But most of them
have a lot of features, that you'll never use and never wanted to, or they are
just too simple for your needs, so you'll be quicker writing your own.

Following the principles of FeinCMS, ElephantBlog tries to offer simple and
basic blog functionality, but remains to be extensible so that you just pick
what you need. And if you don't find an extension, you can quickly write your
own and integrate it to ElephantBlog.
